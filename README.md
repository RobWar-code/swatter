# Swatter - An Online Interactive Graphics Game

## Introduction

The game is for one player and consists of a graphic setting with a 
table with various fragile objects on it and an object to be used as 
swatter that is to be used by the player to strike down various bugs
as they fly or crawl across the table. The object is to strike the bugs
without smashing the fragile objects (points deducted), each successful
strike scores points.

## Layout

The layout consists of a window alcove with net curtains and ornaments
to the left and a set of shelving with ornaments to the right. The
window alcove should be not more than 390px wide, with the adjacent
shelving occupying the remaining 610px of the maximum size stage (1000px);

As the display is shrunk, the scale remains the same, but only those ornaments
visible on the left are displayed. The swatter is moved accordingly.

### Preliminary Visual Design Discursive

If the design is highly visual, then the time budget for the drafting
stage becomes that much longer. So the first choice is between visual
appeal and establishing the game-play value. In an ideal world both
the game play and the visuals are ideal, in practice, we must set
budgetary constraints and game-play is the most significant factor.

I have used DALL-E to obtain visualisations and to experiment to see
how much drafting can be automated, and have come to the conclusion
that there is generally not much time saving using DALL-E for draft
images, but there is substantial visualisation utility, which can be
used to improve quality.

### Notes on Realism

For the sake of simplicity (and execution speeds) the game is 2 dimensional.
Although the visualisations of the incumbent creature could be adjusted
to "represent" a 3D location, to add a flavour of realism.

## Schedule

The following schedule is based on a budget of 12 man weeks (72 days),
so the plan contents are juggled accordingly. This chart will be updated
during the course of the project.
